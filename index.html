    <!-- MAIN BODY DESCRIPTION -->
    <div class="about-box">
      <h2>Welcome to Site-89</h2>
      <p>Site-89 is a community-driven SCP roleplaying experience built from the ground up with a focus on immersion, creativity, and storytelling. Set within the SCP universe, we’ve created a unique platform for roleplay using Minecraft as our medium — but this is far more than just a server.</p>
      <p>Born in May 2024 from a small group of friends passionate about SCP, Site-89 has grown into a fully developed roleplay environment. We saw a gap in serious SCP roleplay spaces outside of platforms like Roblox, and decided to build something better.</p>
      <p>Every system you see here has been carefully crafted: from custom plugins that support deep roleplay mechanics to an in-universe site control and monitoring system powered by ComputerCraft. Whether you're diving into personnel dossiers, managing anomalous objects, or responding to unfolding incidents — Site-89 is built to immerse you.</p>
      <p>Whether you're new to SCP or a long-time fan, welcome, and enjoy your stay at Site-89.</p>
