    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="intro-section">
      <h2>What is This?</h2>
      <p>This is the overview of the Site-89 Staff Team, what they do, and how they are set up in order of ranks. Site-89's staff structure consists of <strong>2 branches</strong>: High Command and Management/Server Staff.</p>
      
      <div class="command-highlight">
        <strong>High Command</strong> is responsible for the overall upkeep of the server, where the server goes, and ensuring that all departments and staff members are meeting their goals.
      </div>
      
      <div class="staff-highlight">
        <strong>Management/Server Staff</strong> is the primary body that does Roleplays and observe the Discord Server. Management is split between Game and Discord, with the Chief Executive Officer and Server Administrators serving at the top as the most trusted members of the server.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- High Command Branch -->
    <div class="branch-section">
      <div class="branch-title">High Command</div>
      <p style="color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 2rem;">Site-89 requires leadership to run, so below is the structure of High Command responsible for server oversight and direction.</p>

      <!-- Site Director -->
      <div class="rank-card">
        <h3>Site Director</h3>
        <p>The Site Director is the current owner of Site-89, and has full control over the server machine, updates, and more.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Deputy Site Director -->
      <div class="rank-card">
        <h3>Deputy Site Director</h3>
        <p>The Deputy Site Director is the second in command in-game, but effectively has the same permissions as the Site Management Board. They also step in as the Server Lead when the Site Director goes on leave.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Site Management Board -->
      <div class="rank-card">
        <h3>Site Management Board</h3>
        <p>The Site Management Board is composed of the CEO, COO, CFO, and CTO, alongside other founding members and the most trusted within the server. They are responsible for oversight of the entire server, along with shaping the future of the site.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; opacity: 0.8;">Usually, they serve as the Director of a Department.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Server Staff Branch -->
    <div class="branch-section">
      <div class="branch-title">Management / Server Staff</div>
      <p style="color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 2rem;">Server Staff are the primary body conducting roleplays and managing the Discord server, ranked by experience and trust level.</p>

      <!-- Chief Executive Officer -->
      <div class="rank-card">
        <h3>Chief Executive Officer</h3>
        <p>The Chief Executive Officer has final decision authority and veto power over any and all decisions tied to the Site-89 project. For the foreseeable future, the CEO also serves as the server host, ensuring continuity and stability across all operations.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Server Administrator -->
      <div class="rank-card">
        <h3>Server Administrator</h3>
        <p>Server Administrators are the highest ranking staff members, trusted by the High Command to have the server's best interests at heart. They have permission to both host roleplays, supervise Trial Roleplay Managers, and manage the Discord Server.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Board of Executives -->
      <div class="rank-card">
        <h3>Board of Executives</h3>
        <p>The Board of Executives consists of the Executives of each department, serving under the Department Director. They functionally have the same permissions as a Roleplay Administrator, with the addition of being high-ranking on the in-roleplay side of the site.</p>
        <p>They also help to shape the server in major decision-making meetings. As the second-highest rank in a department, they are some of the most trusted members on the server.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Roleplay Administrator -->
      <div class="rank-card">
        <h3>Roleplay Administrator</h3>
        <p>Roleplay Administrators are one step above the Roleplay Managers, they have more experience hosting roleplays, and have been in the server for a long time. They are some of the most trusted members on the site.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Roleplay Manager -->
      <div class="rank-card">
        <h3>Roleplay Manager</h3>
        <p>Roleplay Managers are the primary roleplay hosting members. They vary with experience, and are the primary people who should host roleplays. They are supervised by High Command and both Administrator roles.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Trial Roleplay Manager -->
      <div class="rank-card">
        <h3>Trial Roleplay Manager</h3>
        <p>Trial Roleplay Managers are the most junior of the staff team, and have just been accepted into the staff team. They are under close supervision of the Server & Roleplay Administrators until they can prove themselves trustworthy enough to remain.</p>
