    <h2>Getting Started at Site-89</h2>
    <p><strong>Welcome to Site-89!</strong> To get started smoothly, the very first step we strongly recommend is joining our official Discord server. It’s the heart of our community where announcements, roleplay coordination, and general discussion take place. If you’re new to our custom modpack, it’s hosted on the Technic Launcher, and a handy setup guide can be found <a href="/guides/installation-guide/">here</a> to get you in-game without hassle.</p>

    <p>Once you’ve joined Discord, read through the rules carefully—this helps keep our community safe and enjoyable for everyone. After that, jump into the game and create your character. This is your in-universe identity and the foundation of your roleplay experience on Site-89.</p>

    <h2>Choosing Your Department</h2>
    <p>Site-89 offers a variety of departments, each with its own unique role and flavor. Newcomers often find themselves gravitating towards the Scientific Department or the Security Department. If you're fascinated by anomalies and the mysteries behind them, the Scientific Department is your go-to. If you prefer a more tactical, hands-on role with access to firearms and security operations, then Security Department will suit you well.</p>

    <p>If neither sounds like a perfect fit, don’t worry! Head to the Reception Desk in the Entrance Zone where a helpful member of the Administrative Department can talk you through the other departments and help you find the role that fits you best.</p>

    <h2>Learning the Ropes</h2>
    <p>We understand that not everyone is familiar with the SCP universe or the intricacies of roleplay. Thankfully, our collective knowledgebase—built by our experienced builders and staff—is available to help you learn the lore. Your Reception Officer will be your first point of contact for guidance.</p>

    <p>For more detailed roleplay help, or if you have any questions, you can always reach out to a Roleplay Manager, either via Discord or in-game by using the <code>/callstaff</code> command. We’re here to make sure you get comfortable and have fun.</p>

    <h2>Training & Requirements</h2>
    <p>Most departments don’t require mandatory training for new players. However, some departments may have specific training programs or prerequisites. Your department leaders will let you know if any such training is needed to advance or take on specialized roles.</p>

    <h2>Getting Involved in Roleplay</h2>
    <p>Roleplay on Site-89 thrives through community interaction. To get involved in missions and events, keep an eye on the Discord server for coordination and announcements. It’s best to connect with other players who are online or looking to join, and having a Roleplay Manager available helps ensure smooth and immersive gameplay.</p>

    <h2>Community & Conduct</h2>
    <p>Site-89 prides itself on being welcoming to both newcomers and seasoned SCP fans. If you’re new, we’re here to guide you every step of the way. If you’re experienced, we want you to find your people and enjoy rich, engaging roleplay with fellow enthusiasts.</p>

    <p>While roleplay is taken seriously, outside of active sessions we encourage fun and camaraderie—provided no one is harmed and site rules aren’t broken. We expect all members to behave respectfully. Anyone unable to maintain a positive environment will be asked to leave.</p>

    <h2>Keeping Up with Progress and Events</h2>
    <p>Progress is subjective and often tied to your department’s leadership and your individual roleplay journey. To stay updated with the latest site events, storylines, and announcements, make sure to frequently check the Discord server. Major news and updates will also be posted here on the Wikidot homepage.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions at any time, don’t hesitate to ask—we’re excited to have you join the Site-89 community!</p>
