    <h2>» Foreword «</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Character Guide! Here, you'll find a comprehensive resource to help you write characters. Our guide is designed to provide you with experienced tips and essential information for creating compelling characters.</p>

    <h2>» Making a Good Character «</h2>
    <h3>Drafting your Character and Creating Ideas</h3>
    <p>When writing a character, one of the first things you'll likely write is their job or department. This is a good starting point, but it's important to make sure that your character fits the role you've assigned to them. Describe their education, occupation, and experiences that led them to this job, as well as what kind of person they are. If you need inspiration, it's fine to loosely base elements on characters you admire—just be sure to make the character your own.</p>
    <p>If you're unsure where to start, look for examples and inspiration from other characters (but do not copy). The goal is to extract interesting traits and then adapt them into a unique character.</p>

    <h2>» Do Your Research «</h2>
    <p>Many aspects of characters are often poorly researched—job positions, programs, medical conditions, and how real-world systems operate. If your character includes real-world elements, research how they function and what the requirements are. For sensitive subjects such as mental health, ensure you understand and treat them respectfully and accurately.</p>

    <h2>» Tone «</h2>
    <p>Character files should mimic an official document from Internal Affairs: professional, concise, and factual. Avoid slang or narrative storytelling; write as if preparing an internal report. Keep the language straightforward and objective.</p>

    <h2>» [REDACTED] «</h2>
    <p>Terms like [REDACTED], [CLASSIFIED], and [CONFIDENTIAL] are generally unnecessary and can be distracting; avoid them unless there is a specific, justified reason to include them.</p>

    <h2>» Backstories and Their Importance «</h2>
    <p>Backstories are crucial for giving your character depth. Provide motivations and context for their decisions and demeanor, but leave room for character growth in roleplay. Backstories should inform roleplay without constraining it.</p>

    <h2>» What Would The Foundation Know? «</h2>
    <p>Write from the perspective of what an external observer or Foundation investigator would know—keep personal thoughts and private feelings out unless they were expressed or recorded. Present information in a citation format where possible, referencing interviews, records, or public posts.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example citation:</strong><br>
      "According to an interrogation conducted by the Michigan State Police (MSP), Mike stated that the incident did not affect him negatively..."
    </div>

    <h2>» How Aspects of Their Life Affect Them — Unneeded Details in General «</h2>
    <p>Include only details that serve the character’s story. Trauma or medical conditions should be presented in terms of how they influence the character now, not as excessive exposition. Connect past details to present behaviors or skills where relevant.</p>

    <h2>» Why a Specific Department/Division? «</h2>
    <p>Connect the backstory to the department you're applying for. Academic history, previous jobs, or life events should plausibly lead the character toward their role (e.g., scientific interest for ScD applicants).</p>

    <h2>» Getting Creative — Pictures, Videos, Drawings, etc. «</h2>
    <p>Visual elements can make character files more engaging. Use images, artwork, or in-game screenshots—avoid real-life photos. Visuals should enhance immersion without breaking the Minecraft-style aesthetic.</p>

    <h2>» Tropes «</h2>
    <p>Tropes often feel overused. Below are common examples and how to avoid them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mary Sue:</strong> Avoid making a character flawless; ensure flaws have meaningful consequences and affect the story.</li>
      <li><strong>Top of the Class:</strong> Intelligence is fine—avoid excessive achievement overload that feels unrealistic.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Insert:</strong> It’s okay to draw on personal aspects, but aim for originality and depth beyond wish-fulfillment.</li>
      <li><strong>"I'm not like the other girls":</strong> Focus on meaningful, high-quality traits rather than a long list of quirkiness.</li>
      <li><strong>"My family got killed by an SCP":</strong> Try to find unique recruitment hooks beyond the common anomaly-interaction trope.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>» Niches «</h2>
    <p>Find an underused niche to make your character stand out—specialized skills, unique backgrounds, or uncommon interests can spark fresh roleplay opportunities.</p>

    <h2>» Traits, Stories, and Backstories — Bringing Them into RP «</h2>
    <p>Turn backstory elements into RP traits—physical quirks, accents, or personal motivations add flavor and create in-game interactions that feel organic.</p>

    <h2>» Grammar and Sloppiness «</h2>
    <p>Good grammar and careful proofreading matter. Use tools like Grammarly or have another person review your file to avoid errors and show effort.</p>

    <h2>» Killing Off Your Character «</h2>
    <p>Character death can be permanent (permadeath) or temporary (semi-permadeath via resignations, amnestics, or AWOL). For details, see the Character Death Guide.</p>
